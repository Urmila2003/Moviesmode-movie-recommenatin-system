# What is the task trying to measure?

This task is trying to measure the ability of language models to propose relevant movie predictions to a user, based on an input prompt sentence enumerating 10 liked movies.Content-based filtering in recommender systems leverages machine learning algorithms to predict and recommend new but similar items to the user. Recommending products based on their characteristics is only possible if there is a clear set of features for the product and a list of the userâ€™s choices.
