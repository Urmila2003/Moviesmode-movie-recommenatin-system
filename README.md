# Moviesmode-movie-recommenatin-system
This task evaluates the ability of language models to propose relevant movie recommendations with collaborative filtering data.

# What is the task trying to measure?

This task is trying to measure the ability of language models to propose relevant movie predictions to a user, based on an input prompt sentence enumerating 10 liked movies.

# Motivation

Automatic recommendations (prediction of relevant items) is a widespread application of artificial intelligence. Content-based filtering in recommender systems leverages machine learning algorithms to predict and recommend new but similar items to the user. Recommending products based on their characteristics is only possible if there is a clear set of features for the product and a list of the userâ€™s choices.

The model automatically suggests the third movie rather than the fourth, since it is more similar to the first two. This similarity can be calculated based on a number of features like the actors and actresses in the movie, the director, the genre, the duration of the film, etc.

# Data source
top10K-TMDB-movies.csv is used as dataset for this project as it contains upto 10k movies. It contains the language ,overview and vote count of different movies.
